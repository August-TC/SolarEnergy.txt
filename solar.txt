# A recommendation of energy

Good afternoon every one! I'm TC representing for Guangdong Solar Energy Company. According to our research of the geographical environment of Xi'an, Xi'an is located in plain which is beneficial to build up a large amount of solar module or solar panel, which is more efficient for people to collect solar energy and transform it into electricity in order to support daily use of electricity. What's more, there are rich solar energy in Xi'an. Xi'an has nearly 2350 hours of sunshine per year which can be collect as energy. Therefore I recommend to set up solar energy facilities in Xi'an so that people have rich energy to use without pollution.
