# A recommendation of solar energy

Good afternoon every one! I'm TC representing for Guangdong Solar Energy Company. According to our research of the geographical environment of Xi'an, Xi'an is located in plain which is beneficial to build up a large amount of solar module or solar panel, which is more efficient for people to collect solar energy and transform it into electricity in order to support daily use of electricity. What's more, there are rich solar energy in Xi'an. Xi'an has nearly 2350 hours of sunshine per year which can be collect as energy. Therefore I recommend to set up solar energy facilities in Xi'an so that people have rich energy to use without pollution.
My company has planned several ways to take full advantage of solar energy. Firstly, we're going to replace some public facilities that need electricity such as streetlights, traffic lights, and electronic billboards. Next, we will apply a large wasteland to build up solar modules or solar panels and related establishments in order to produce steady electric power to satisfy people's daily requirement. At last our company plans to set up a research and development departments in Xi'an to create more and more high-tech products to use solar energy.
